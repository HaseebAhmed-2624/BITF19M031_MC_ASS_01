  <h2>An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners (Tutorial)</h2>
  <p>New to git? Follow the steps below to get comfortable making changes to the code base, opening up a pull request
    (PR), and merging code into the primary branch. Any important git and GitHub terms are in bold with links to the
    official git reference materials. </p>
  <h2>Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account</h2>
  <p>The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.
    Follow the instructions here to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be
    using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's
    easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable
    with the command. A note: 95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line
    interface.
    Once you've done that, create a GitHub account here.</p>
  <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
  <p>A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005
    by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which
    integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many
    other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All
    of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote
    to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>
  <h2>Step 1: Create a local git repository </h2>
  <p>When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (or often,
    'repo', for short).
    To use git we'll be using the terminal. If you don't have much experience with the terminal and basic commands,
    check out this tutorial (If you don’t want/ need a short history lesson, skip to step three.)
    To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the cd
    (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something
    like:</p>
  <h2>Step 2: Add a new file to the repo</h2>
  <p>Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `touch
    newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt.
    Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that the file exists inside
    the repo. But, git won't track the file unless you explicitly tell it to. Git only saves/manages changes to files
    that it tracks, so we’ll need to send a command to confirm that yes, we want git to track our new
    <br> After creating the new file, you can use the git status command to see which files git knows exist.<br>What
    this basically says is, "Hey, we noticed you created a new file called mnelson.txt, but unless you use the 'git add'
    command we aren't going to do anything with it."</p>
  <h3>An interlude: The staging environment, the commit, and you</h3>
  <p>One of the most confusing parts when you're first learning git is the concept of the staging environment and how it
    relates to a commit. A commit is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make
    changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and then tell git to put those changes into a
    commit. Commits make up the essence of your project and allow you to jump to the state of a project at any other commit.
    So, how do you tell git which files to put into a commit? This is where the staging environment or index come in. As
    seen in Step 2, when you make changes to your repo, git notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with
    it (like adding it in a commit). To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add
    command.
      Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell
      git to package them into a commit using the git commit command.
      Note: The staging environment, also called 'staging', is the new preferred term for this, but you can also see it
      referred to as the 'index'.
  </p>
<h2>Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment</h2>
  <p>Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command.

If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line).
    <br>To reiterate, the file has not yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.</p>
  <h3>Step 4: Create a commit</h3>
  <p>It's time to create your first commit! Run the command git commit -m "Your message about the commit"</p>
<p>The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo. Don't put a message like "asdfadsf" or "foobar". That makes the other people who see your commit sad. Very, very, sad. Commits live forever in a repository (technically you can delete them if you really, really need to but it’s messy), so if you leave a clear explanation of your changes it can be extremely helpful for future programmers (perhaps future you!) who are trying to figure out why some change was made years later.</p>
  <h3>Step 5: Create a new branch</h3>
